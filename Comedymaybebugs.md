Bugs are scarier than humans. No one has changed, or is about to change my opinion on that. For sure. So yes, it was an absolute nightmare to live in a bug-infested villa. 
Bug infested, I repeat. If you have a similar fear, I'm sure you can relate. If you don't, please get lost. No, just kidding. Don't leave just yet, please read on. 

Sure, now that you know of my absolute disgust towards these flying and non-flying creatures alike, back to the villa. Well, the villa was, as I said, bug-infested, and clearly,
not very liveable in my standards. Then again, where was I to find a luxurious hotel I had hoped for in the dead of night in this old, run-down village I had no intention of 
going to in the very first place. That's right, if I had not been so foolish as to follow my foolisher brother up to the mountains on his "enjoyably short" car ride, 
perhaps I would be back in my cosy hotel soaking in the warm bathtub...... Instead of here, stuck up high in the foggy mountains in a bug-infested villa. Bug-infested. 

Now, if you're thinking it can't be that bad, I will prove you wrong in the next instances. So, imagine you're in a villa, wifi's probably not that good, and air-con,
a little wonky. You're reassuring yourself that just one night can't kill and decide to take a bath before drifting off into a deep sleep. Hopefully. You enter the bathroom,
but you're greeted by a giant who-knows-what-kind-of bug. It looks a little like a pinhole camera so you go closer to find out, cause why not. But, no, it's a bug. It's big and 
fat, black and maybe a little shiny.... I will stop with the descriptions because the thought of it is absolutely..... Disgusting. Then it starts flying. Naturally, you scream 
your head off. If you're as unfortunate as me to have a brother who happens to be in the shower when this happens, good luck then.

So, the bug's probably scared of you, ironically and flies out the small window in the bathroom. Well done. You begin showering, still a little wary in case it comes back.... 
when another "it" appears. This time, it's rectangular-shaped and brown and..... I will stop here. Clearly, it's a cockroach. Perhaps because of your fear of bugs, you 
instinctively know cockroaches fly. Fly, I repeat. You, meanwhile, naked and stuck in a small, cramped bathroom. With the cockroach. Again, you scream and in a moment of fear, 
spray water with the shower-head at the horrendous creature currently crawling up the tiled wall. Somehow, it fails to fly before getting drenched, falling to the floor and 
whoosh, into the drain. The rest of the shower? You finish it within minutes, staying clear of the horrifying drain. 

After your shower, you feel a little peckish and decide to take a look at the villa's fridge because you remembered the receptionist told you there was food and beverage in it.
Usually, I wouldn't but clearly, how expensive could the food here, especially here, get? Then, you get the fright of your life. There's a bunch of tiny, black six-legged
creatures crawling in a frenzy at the small drain-like thing on the floor next to the sink. Now, you probably know what's going to happen next. You scream. And scream.

Your most annoying brother is finally out of the bathroom and comes knocking on your door. You open the door, he's probably not the most concerned but at least bothers to ask
what is going on with his little sister. Frightened and slightly irritated, you say, "ants" and cross your arms. Because you blame your brother for your current state. He goes 
to check it out and though a little expected because he's your brother, he says, "Just leave it alone. We're leaving tomorrow anyway." 

This simply wasn't the end of your experience in this bug-infested villa. Bug-infested.
